                                    Machine Learning Engineers are sophisticated ML experts who specialize in designing and building intelligent machines and systems that can learn from experience and perform human-like tasks with minimal or no human supervision. They create advanced ML algorithms that can teach computers how to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for the same. Also, Machine Learning Engineers develop state-of-the-art ML and Deep Learning systems and run various ML tests and experiments to innovate unique AI-powered machines.

                                    Data Scientists are the masters of the Data Science domain. They are mainly concerned with creating value from complex data. Data Scientists gather data not only from the company repository but also from multiple external sources (social media, websites, blogs, etc.). They clean, organize and process this data to further analyze it for extracting the hidden patterns within it. This helps them understand how the data at hand can solve the present business challenges an organization.
